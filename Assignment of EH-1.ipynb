When an exceptional situation arises, Python raises an exception, which can then be caught and handled by the program."

    ":-> In short we can say, exceptions occur during the runtime of a program when something unexpected happens, while syntax errors occur during the parsing phase of the program when the code is being checked for correct syntax before execution. To handle exceptions, you can use try-except blocks to catch and handle specific exceptions that may arise during the execution of your program. Syntax errors must be fixed before the program can run."

    "## Answer :->\n",
    "#### Custom exceptions, also known as user-defined exceptions, are exceptions that you create by defining your own exception classes in Python. These custom exceptions allow you to raise and handle specific types of errors that are relevant to your application or domain. You need custom exceptions when the built-in Python exceptions don't adequately capture the nature of the errors you want to handle, or when you want to provide more meaningful error messages and context to developers using your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Do We Need Custom Exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Expressiveness: Custom exceptions provide a way to express and categorize specific errors that are meaningful in the context of your application. They make your code more self-documenting and help others understand the purpose of each exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Clarity: Custom exceptions allow you to provide detailed error messages that offer clear guidance on how to handle and troubleshoot issues. This improves the debugging and error recovery process.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Separation of Concerns: By defining custom exceptions, you can separate the logic for handling specific types of errors from the core application logic. This makes your code cleaner and easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Granular Error Handling: Custom exceptions enable you to handle different errors in different ways, providing more granular control over error handling and recovery strategies."

    "2. Create a divide function that checks if the denominator is zero and raises the CustomError if it is.\n",
    "3. In the try block, we call the divide function with arguments 10 and 0, which triggers the custom exception. We then catch and handle the CustomError exception in the except block and print the custom error message, providing clear information about the error.\n",
